Animal Adoptions is a service that will be provided to animal shelters. It will allow them to promote the animals that are ready to be adopted and make an easier process for the adoption.

Some of the features that I'm adding to this service are:

- Show the animals that are ready to be adopted
- Share albums from the animals that are ready to be adopted
- Provide a form where people can make their requests to adopt an animal
- Provide an algorithm to help the shelters to know who is the best candidate to adopt the animal.
- Allow the shelter to have all the information of adopted animals
