DunnoTap is a board game based on the Whac-A-Mole game. DunnoTap's board has nine wooden boxes. Each box will rotate one at a time; when a box rotates, it can show you one of these icons:
- Golden bar (will give you points when you tap over it)
- Axe (will get you points out when you tap over it)

You have time and a minimum score to complete each level. The higher the level, the fastest the box rotates (in and out).

Here is one of the sketches that we did while we where planning DunnoTap. The characters changed as we were developing the game but the core continued as we planned it.
