As a personal project, I decided that I wanted to learn more programming languages and other frameworks, so I decided to start with Swift. I searched on many sources and found that the certification from Coursera was a good start for this language.

The certification was divided in the following courses:
- Introduction To Swift
- Programming iOS App Development Basics
- App Design and Development for iOS
- Build Your Own iOS App

At the end of the courses, I completed the certification with a project where I allowed the user to choose between several options that they could use as a mask over their faces. The masks that I added are:
- Pirate: Adds a pirate hat, pirate eye patch and a piercing over your nose.
- Heisenberg: Adds a black hat, sunglasses and moustache.
- Clown: Adds over your face a red clown wig, a clown nose and over your eyes two rotating stars.
- Party: Adds over your head a party hat and some balloons that appear and disappear.

Here you will find the certifications from Coursera and University of Toronto: [https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/NEUMMPLPSYR4](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/NEUMMPLPSYR4)

And here you will find a short video where I show you how does it works: [https://youtu.be/okx0ovYgKS0](https://youtu.be/okx0ovYgKS0)

Here is an example of how this tool added a mask over the face:
